# Developer Vision and Commitment

This repository exists for one reason only:
to keep me committed to the developer I aspire to be.

## 🎯 Long-Term Goal

I am 15 years old and my goal is that, by age 18, I will be prepared to seek a remote software engineering position, especially in companies based in the USA.

## 📍 Where I Am Now

- Studying programming consistently
- Completing my studies at DevMedia
- Building projects while studying, without postponing practice
- Fully aware that I am still at the beginning of the journey and that mastery takes time

---

## 🧠 Learning Strategy

My strategy is intentional and long-term:

### 1. Fundamentals First
- Deep understanding of JavaScript
- Sharp logical reasoning
- Knowing *why* things work, not just *how*

### 2. Courses as Tools, Not Crutches

- DevMedia: fundamentals and practice
- Luiz Otávio Miranda's course: Deepening Understanding of Logic, JavaScript, and TypeScript

- Frameworks only make sense after a solid foundation is laid

### 3. TypeScript-First Mindset
- JavaScript is the mental model
- TypeScript is the production language
- Focus on correctness, clarity, and scalability

### 4. Personal Projects
- Every learned concept should be transformed into code
- Simple, functional, and constantly evolving projects
- A completed project, even if imperfect, is worth more than ten abandoned ones

## 🛠️ Current Focus on Technologies

- TypeScript
- Node.js
- APIs
- Databases
- React (with TypeScript, when appropriate)
Without constantly changing technologies.

Depth above novelty.

## 🚫 What I Refuse to Be

- Someone who only consumes courses
- Someone who avoids difficult problems
- Someone who gives up when they get stuck
- Someone who confuses being busy with progressing

---

## 📈 Personal Rules

Consistency > Motivation
Clarity > Anxiety
Delivered code > Perfect code

If I follow this long enough, the results will be inevitable.

## 📝 Note to My Future Self

If you're reading this a few years from now:

Remember where it all started, you at age 12 tinkering with Scratch, you started studying Python at the end of 2024, and in mid-April 2025, after grasping Python logic, you started with HTML and CSS, and those HTML and CSS modules took a while. Then you started JS in August and learned React at the end of 2025, started with Node 4 days ago, and today you're already creating an API. Now in 2026 I'll finish DevMedia, the database module is missing, and after that you'll start Luiz Otavio's JS/TS course to recap logic and practice every day. I'll be posting my progress in this repository.

Keep doing the basics well.

Don't abandon the process.
